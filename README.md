# Bluesky Post Analyser
I have been trying to improve my Python knowledge, so I built a simple app. It allows you to analyse your Bluesky Posts. It creates 3 different charts showing which of your posts have been the most successful, what are your engagement metrics, and it recommends you the best time to post focusing on which topics. You can also just download your post data as a CSV file and analyse yourself.

The functioning app has been published to PythonAnywhere and can be accessed here: https://thatakin.pythonanywhere.com/
